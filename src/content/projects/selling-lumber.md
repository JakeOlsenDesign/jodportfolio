## Overview
Selling Lumber, a program by Reality Sales Training, is a virtual sales manager course created to accelerate the professional development of lumber salespeople. It is led by James Olsen, an experienced sales coach with a background in lumber trading. The core mission is to transform new sales professionals into profitable contributors in a matter of months, while also giving experienced salespeople a significant competitive edge. The program and company are dedicated to providing "Real Training, Real Consulting, Real Results" to help clients achieve their sales goals.

## Challenges
* Slow Onboarding Process: The traditional learning curve for new salespeople in the specialized lumber industry is often long, delaying their ability to contribute to the bottom line.
* Building Sales Confidence and Skills: Both new and experienced sales professionals can benefit from structured training to improve their closing techniques, negotiation skills, and ability to manage accounts effectively.
* Effective Knowledge Transfer: The challenge was to condense James Olsen's decades of experience into a structured, accessible format that could be effectively transferred to a wide range of sales professionals.

## Solutions
* Comprehensive Virtual Training Course: The "Selling Lumber: The Virtual Sales Manager" course was developed, offering over 7.5 hours of video lessons, e-books, and quizzes to provide a complete and structured learning path.
* Diverse and Accessible Content: The curriculum was designed to cover a broad spectrum of topics, from fundamental sales techniques like closing and opening new accounts to "soft skills" such as understanding different personality types and active listening.
* Reinforced Learning through Micro-Content: To keep lessons fresh and reinforce key concepts, the program includes over 200 "Sales Reality Check Videos," which are short, focused clips sent twice a week to participants.
* Multi-Faceted Training Programs: Reality Sales Training offers a range of other products, including multi-topic training bundles, single-topic downloads on subjects like negotiation, and books, to cater to various learning needs and budgets.

## Results
* Accelerated Profitability: By providing a structured and comprehensive virtual sales manager program, the time it takes for new salespeople to become profitable is significantly reduced.
* Improved Sales Performance: Both new and seasoned salespeople gain a competitive advantage by mastering essential sales techniques, closing strategies, and account management skills.
* Scalable and Consistent Training: The virtual format allows for consistent, high-quality training to be delivered to an entire sales team, ensuring everyone receives the same core knowledge and skills.

This case study demonstrates how Selling Lumber and Reality Sales Training successfully addressed the unique training needs of the lumber industry, providing a powerful, virtual solution that delivers tangible results and empowers sales professionals to excel.
