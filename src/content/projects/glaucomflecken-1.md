  Dr. and Lady Glaucomfecken are extremely tapped in with their target market.
  They grew their audience from sharing and criticizing the faults of the
  healthcare system with humor and irreverence that resonated with healthcare
  workers. This stemmed from a desire to bring joy to their viewers with a
  message of kindness and hope to make things better in the healthcare.


  It was important that we showcased their playful personalities while keeping a professional demeanor. This challenge was highlighted since they wished to branch into more podcasting and public speaking and wanted to balance their humor and opinions on serious matters.

branding: Featuring duo-colored logo, the main Gluacomflecken logo leverages the
  partnership between Kristin and Will. While the main logo focuses on their
  teamwork, we created separate identities with their own respective colors to
  designate a distinction between the two. Kristin and Will work together but
  also contribute different ways and are passionate about different aspects of
  Healthcare. vThe pattern and logo mark are inspired by the medical term
  “glaukomflecken” which graphically lends itself to a fun theme while the
  typography evokes feelings of professionalism.

webdesign: The primary purpose for the website is to showcase who they are, what
  they do, and provide social proof for users to book them for speaking events
  and listen to their podcast. It was important to promote that they share their
  knowledge through a variety of avenues. We utilized the brand identity to
  design an engaging experience to guide users through the website and find the
  information they need easily.

background: Will creates medical-themed comedy shorts for an audience of over 3
  million across social media as “Dr. Glaucomflecken”. Kristin (“Lady
  Glaucomflecken”) teaches healthcare workers about the patient and family
  experience and advocates for caregivers and “co-survivors,” CPR and AED use,
  and sudden cardiac arrest survivorship. Together and individually, we use our
  social media presence, impactful writing, creative endeavors, and multimedia
  keynote speaking to promote humanity, and a healthy sense of humor, in
  healthcare.
outcome: >-
  The Glaucomflecken rebrand and website redesign transformed their online
  presence into a dynamic, scalable platform that celebrates their humor,
  advocacy, and professionalism. By crafting a cohesive brand identity with
  vibrant visuals and tailored messaging, we captured the essence of Dr. Will
  and Kristin Flanary’s mission to inspire hope and humanity in healthcare.


  The new website seamlessly guides visitors to learn more, listen to their podcast, and book speaking engagements, making it a powerful tool for connecting with their growing audience and stakeholders. This strategic approach not only strengthened their brand recognition but also empowered them to expand their impact across digital and live platforms.
