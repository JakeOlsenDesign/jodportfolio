description: It was time to give Edge One Media it's own refreshing edge! We
  evolved the homepage to explore what makes us passionate about serving the
  Portland Community
overview: >-
  Edge One Media is a branding, marketing, and web design & development studio
  rooted in strategy, creativity, and community. As our work and capabilities
  evolved, our website and brand presentation no longer reflected who we are
  today—or where we’re going next.


  We set out to redesign our own brand and website with the same care, process, and standards we apply to our clients. That meant stepping back, challenging assumptions, and rebuilding our digital presence from the ground up.

## Challenges

**1. Positioning**\
\
Edge One Media offers many different services depending on needs of the client and needed clearer messaging about what they do, who they serve, and why they do it; without being too complicated.

**2. Visual Identity**\
\
The existing brand needed a refresh and refinement to better reflect the balance of strategy, creativity, and technical execution. This needed to feel familiar and approachable yet fresh and innovative.

**3. Improving Structure & User Experience**\
\
Edge One Media grew organically over time. It's content and projects needed to be reorganized, navigation simplified, and user flow improved to better guide visitors through its services and work.

## Solutions

**1. Discovery-First Approach**\
\
We treated Edge One Media like a client, starting with a full discovery process. This included evaluating our positioning, strengths, gaps, competitors, goals, vision, and mission, then defining a clear roadmap forward.

**2. Stylescapes & Mockups**\
\
Insights from discovery guided our stylescapes. After choosing a direction, this led into multiple homepage mockups. This allowed us to explore visual directions, align internally, and make strategic design decisions before development began.

**4. Custom Design & Development**\
\
The site was rebuilt with a refreshed visual system, refined typography, and custom details—like dynamically generated floating clouds in the hero—to add personality without distracting from usability. We wanted it to clearly answer the question, "Why Edge One Media?".

## Results

**A Clearer, Stronger Brand Presence**

The updated branding and messaging more accurately reflects how Edge One Media has evolved as a studio.

**A Platform Built for Growth**

Our new website isn’t just a refresh—it’s a foundation that supports future content, case studies, and continued evolution.

## Conclusion

Redesigning Edge One Media's own website was both a challenge and a way to improve and refine its own process. By applying the same discovery-driven, strategy-led approach used for clients, we created a digital presence that feels aligned, intentional, and ready for what’s next.
