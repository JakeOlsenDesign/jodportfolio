  ## Overview


  Edge One Media is a branding, marketing, and web design & development studio rooted in strategy, creativity, and community. As our work and capabilities evolved, our website and brand presentation no longer reflected who we are today—or where we’re going next.


  We set out to redesign our own brand and website with the same care, process, and standards we apply to our clients. That meant stepping back, challenging assumptions, and rebuilding our digital presence from the ground up.

## Challenges

**1. Clarifying Our Positioning**\
\
As a multidisciplinary studio, we needed clearer messaging around what we do, who we serve, and how we’re different—without overcomplicating the story.

**2. Updating the Visual Identity**\
\
Our existing brand system needed refinement to better reflect our balance of strategy, creativity, and technical execution—while still feeling familiar and approachable.

**3. Improving Structure & User Experience**\
\
The previous site had grown organically over time. Content needed to be reorganized, navigation simplified, and user flow improved to better guide visitors through our services and work.

**4. Designing for Performance Across Devices**\
\
With most users discovering and researching brands on mobile, the new site needed to prioritize mobile performance, clarity, and accessibility from the start.

## Solutions

**1. Discovery-First Approach**\
\
We treated ourselves like a client—starting with a full discovery process. This included evaluating our positioning, strengths, gaps, competitors, goals, vision, and mission, then defining a clear roadmap forward.

**2. Moodboards & High-Fidelity Mockups**\
\
Insights from discovery were translated into high-fidelity moodboards and multiple homepage mockups. This allowed us to explore visual directions, align internally, and make strategic design decisions before development began.

**3. Thoughtful Content Hierarchy**\
\
We redefined what information mattered most and how it should flow—focusing on clarity, scannability, and answering the question: “Why Edge One Media?”

**4. Custom Design & Development**\
\
The site was rebuilt with a refreshed visual system, refined typography, and custom details—like dynamically generated floating clouds in the hero—to add personality without distracting from usability.

**5. Mobile-First & Launch-Ready Execution**\
\
The site was built with mobile-first principles, SEO considerations, and a thorough launch checklist to ensure performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Results

**A Clearer, Stronger Brand Presence**

The updated branding and messaging more accurately reflect who we are as a studio—strategic, creative, and collaborative.

**An Improved User Experience**

Simplified navigation, refined content flow, and intentional design choices make it easier for users to understand our services, explore our work, and get in touch.

**A Platform Built for Growth**

Our new website isn’t just a refresh—it’s a foundation that supports future content, case studies, and continued evolution.

## Conclusion

Redesigning our own website was both a challenge and a reminder of why process matters. By applying the same discovery-driven, design-led approach we use for clients, we created a digital presence that feels aligned, intentional, and ready for what’s next.
