## **Overview**

Gosselin Martin Associates (G/MA) is a nationally recognized leader in healthcare facilities management recruitment, succession planning, and career development. With decades of experience, G/MA connects hospitals and systems with top-tier facilities professionals. As their services expanded to include educational content like the Healthcare Facilities Network and the High Reliability Podcast, they needed a refreshed brand identity and website that reflected their growth while honoring their established reputation.

## Challenges

1. **Updating a Legacy Logo**\
   G/MA's original logo had strong recognition but appeared dated. The challenge was to modernize it subtly, preserving brand equity while enhancing visual appeal.
2. **Enhancing Digital Presence**\
   Their existing website lacked intuitive navigation and did not effectively showcase their comprehensive services and resources.
3. **Organizing Expanding Content**\
   With a growing library of podcasts, blogs, and educational materials, G/MA needed a structured platform to make content easily accessible to diverse audiences.

## Solutions

1. **Refined Brand Identity**\
   The logo was updated with modern typography and a refreshed color palette, maintaining its core elements to ensure continuity and recognition.
2. **Custom Website Design**\
   A new website was developed featuring streamlined navigation, clear calls to action, and dedicated sections for services, job listings, and educational content.
3. **Content Organization Strategy**\
   The site architecture was restructured to categorize content effectively, allowing users to easily find information relevant to their interests, whether they're employers, job seekers, or industry professionals.

## Results

1. **Modernized Brand Image**\
   The refreshed logo and website design present G/MA as a forward-thinking firm while respecting its established legacy.
2. **Improved User Engagement**\
   Enhanced site navigation and organized content have led to increased user interaction and easier access to resources.
3. **Strengthened Industry Position**\
   The updated digital presence reinforces G/MA's role as a thought leader in healthcare facilities management, attracting new clients and partners.

This brand and website refresh positions Gosselin Martin Associates to continue leading in healthcare facilities management recruitment and education, with a modern platform that supports their mission and growth.
