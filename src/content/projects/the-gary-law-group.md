## Overview

The Gary Law Group (GLG) are more than just a law firm, they work closely with their clients to become partners in risk prevention for window and door manufacturers. Instead of just defending clients, their goal is to help businesses avoid legal trouble altogether.

GLG needed a brand identity and website refresh that communicated their proactive approach, role as educators, risk mitigators, and long-term allies - setting them apart from traditional law firms while reinforcing their leadership in fenestration law.

## Challenges

### 1. Differentiating from Traditional Law Firms

Instead of acting as a know-it-all authority - GLG needed to highlight their role as strategic partners, helping clients navigate risk, protect their bottom line, and grow with confidence.

### 2. Elevating Brand Identity & Messaging

GLG’s needed a refined identity that balanced professionalism with an approachable, problem-solving mindset.

### 3. Creating a User-Centric Digital Experience

While content-rich, their website lacked intuitive navigation. GLG needed a structured, info-driven site to position them as industry leaders and make legal insights easy to find.

### 4. Strengthening Messaging & Engagement

Many manufacturers don’t realize they need legal counsel until it’s too late. GLG’s new website needed to emphasize early legal consultation, helping businesses mitigate risks before they escalate.

## Solutions

### 1. A Brand Identity That Reflects Partnership & Expertise

* New messaging positioning GLG as strategic partners reducing risk before it becomes a legal claim.
* Refined tagline, “Window And Door Risk Management Specialists”.
* Modernized visual identity using deep purples and grays to evoke trust and stability.

### 2. A Website Built for Clarity & Engagement

* Streamlined navigation to highlight key services and actionable risk-prevention strategies.
* Resource Hub featuring expert articles and case studies, reinforcing GLG’s authority in fenestration law.
* Interactive CTAs, Q&A sections, and lead forms to encourage early engagement.

### 3. Content & Thought Leadership Strategy

* Educator-first approach positioning GLG as industry mentors.
* Storytelling integration using real-world scenarios: *“Imagine facing a major legal claim—what could you have done differently?”*.

## Conclusion

### 1. A Distinctive, Industry-Focused Brand

* GLG’s new branding positions them as trusted advisors and reinforces their collaborative approach to risk prevention.

### 2. A More Functional, Engaging Website

* A clearer, more structured site helping manufacturers and distributors find the information they need easily.
* A resource-driven approach that focuses on their services and what they provide for higher engagement with legal insights and educational content.

With GLG, we have built a brand identity and online platform that is ready to grow with them while they create valuable relationships with proactive industry-specific solutions.
