                <p>I'm Jake, a Portland-based brand and web designer. I work with businesses, designing strategic brands and online solutions built to best serve their customers and communities. I have had an amazing opportunity collaborating with 100+ businesses creating solutions for their unique needs and challenges - from logo + template site packages for family-owned businesses looking to take the next step to multi-medium $1M+ fundraising campaigns to provide healthcare for the underserved. The following projects are some of my favorites and display a breadth of my work.</p>
