                <p class="subtitle">Brand & Web Designer in Portland, OR</p>
                <p>I design strategic brands and custom web solutions to stimulate growth. I have 10 years of progressive experience, delivering over 100+ successful projects. I enjoy partnering with businesses to define their brand and, in tandem, build cohesive websites and custom digital solutions that support their growth.</p>
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Expertise:</strong> Brand Identity, UI/UX Design, Custom Web Development (WordPress, PHP, JS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Led $1.5M+ fundraising campaigns and scaled e-commerce solutions to $200k/year.</li>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I believe in life-long learning; adapting to whatever is necessary to complete a project, refining my process, and keeping up with effective industry tools (AI being an industry defining one right now). My approach is rooted in transparency and collaboration. I believe the best solutions come from knowing a client's unique challenges and exploring the best solution to acheive their goals.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include playing basketball, visiting new restaurants, Magic the Gathering, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
