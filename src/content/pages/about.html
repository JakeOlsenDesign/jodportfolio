                <p class="subtitle">Brand & Web Designer in Portland, OR</p>
                <p>I design strategic brands and custom web solutions to stimulate growth. I have 10 years of progressive experience, delivering over 100+ successful projects. I enjoy partnering with businesses to define their brand and, in tandem, build cohesive websites and custom digital solutions that support their growth.</p>
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Expertise:</strong> Brand Identity, UI/UX Design, Custom Web Development (WordPress, PHP, JS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Led $1.5M+ fundraising campaigns and scaled e-commerce solutions to $200k/year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leadership::</strong> Current Lead Designer at Edge One Media; specializing in client discovery and team mentorship.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My approach is rooted in transparency and collaboration. I believe the best design solutions come from truly knowing a client's unique challenges. I don't just hand over a file; I strategize a roadmap.</p>
                <p>As a former collegiate athlete and current Lead Designer, I thrive in fast-paced team environments. I’m just as comfortable presenting a brand strategy to a boardroom as I am writing custom PHP to solve a complex functional hurdle.</p>
